      <title>The effect of Language switching on bilingual toddlers&#39; word learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this experiment, we are investigating bilingual toddlers’ learning of cross-language synonyms (i.e., translation equivalents) in immediate translated sentences versus single language sentences. Bilingual toddlers’ word learning will be assessed with an online asynchronous experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cognate advantage in bilingual infants</title>
      <link>https://rachelkytsui.github.io/project/cogvocab-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bilingual infants grow up with the unique experience of needing to learn two words for most concepts. These words are called translation equivalents, and translation equivalents that also sound similar (e.g., banana-banane) are called cognates. Research has consistently shown that children and adults process cognates more easily than non-cognates. The present study explored if there is such an advantage for cognate production in bilingual’s early vocabulary development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are translation equivalents special?</title>
      <link>https://rachelkytsui.github.io/project/te-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of translation equivalents is often considered a special component of bilingual children’s vocabulary development, as bilinguals have to learn words that share the same meaning across their two languages. This study examined three contrasting accounts for bilingual children’s acquisition of translation equivalents relative to words that are first labels for a referent: the Avoidance Account whereby translation equivalents are harder to learn, the Preference Account whereby translation equivalents are easier to learn, and the Neutral Account whereby translation equivalents are similar to learn. To adjudicate between these accounts, we put forward a computational model — the Bilingual Vocabulary Model — which proposes that the number of translation equivalents bilingual children produce is a function of vocabulary learning in each language, in the context of the number of potentially learnable words given the children’s developmental level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Development of tone perceptions in Cantonese-learning infants</title>
      <link>https://rachelkytsui.github.io/project/tone-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Infants begin life with a remarkable ability to discriminate a wide range of phonetic contrasts, both native and non-native. Within the first year of life, infants’ phonetic discrimination ability undergoes a significant reorganization from being language-general to being language-specific. However, the developmental pattern is actually more complex than previously thought: Certain contrasts can only be discriminated in the second half of the first year. This project probes Cantonese-learning infants’ ability to discriminate lexical tones in their native language. Lexical tones are considered an expansion of the phoneme inventory in a tone language, where pitch variations also signal lexical meaning differences. Through Cantonese which contrasts its lexical tones through changes in pitch height and pitch contour, this project examines how the development of lexical tone perception in Cantonese-learning infants is affected by the pitch characteristics of lexical tones.&lt;/p&gt;
